# ShapeUp - Personal Fitness Trainer

The ShapeUp project aims to provide users with a personalized Machine-Learning-driven fitness coach that tracks workouts for individual goals and needs, enhancing their fitness journey.

By the end of the ShapeUp project, I want to have developed a fully functional ML-driven fitness coach app that provides and tracks user's movements throughout their workout routine.

A ShapeUp application will take the OpenComputerVision(OpenCV), MediaPipe, and NumPy on Python.

# MealMetric - Your Nutrition Tracker

The MealMetric project aims to offer users an intuitive web app for easily tracking their daily calorie intake and managing their nutritional goals, helping users maintain a balanced diet and achieve their health objectives.

By the end of the MealMetric project, I want to have developed a comprehensive and user-friendly web app that offers detailed nutritional insights and supports users in maintaining a balanced diet.

A MealMetric web application will take HTML, CSS, JavaScript, open-sourced APIs, and Django on Python.
